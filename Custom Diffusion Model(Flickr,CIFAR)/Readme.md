# Fine-Tuning CLIP and Diffusion Model for Image Generation

This combined documentation covers the implementation of fine-tuning CLIP for CIFAR-10 and Flickr8k datasets and using a latent diffusion model to generate images from text.

---

## **1. Diffusion Model**

### **1.1 Project Requirements**
- Use a latent diffusion model to generate images from text.
- Fine-tune OpenAI’s CLIP model to align textual and visual embeddings.
- Utilize pre-trained VAE, U-Net, and scheduler for the diffusion pipeline.
- Use an appropriate dataset with image captions for fine-tuning.

---

### **1.2 CLIP Fine-Tuning**
- A custom `CLIPFineTuner` class is created to fine-tune CLIP by adding projection layers.
- Aligns text and image features into a shared embedding space for similarity calculations.

---

### **1.3 Stable Diffusion Pipeline**
- **Autoencoder (VAE)**: Decodes latent space into image space.
- **Tokenizer & Text Encoder**: Tokenizes and encodes text inputs.
- **U-Net**: Generates latents from noise guided by textual embeddings.
- **Scheduler**: Implements the sampling process for denoising latents.

---

### **1.4 Image Generation**
- A function generates images from textual prompts by:
  - Tokenizing the text.
  - Creating latent noise.
  - Iteratively refining latents using the U-Net and scheduler.
  - Decoding latents into image space using the VAE.

---

### **1.5 Output**
- The model generates realistic images based on text prompts.
- Users can fine-tune CLIP for customized textual embedding and improved results.

## **2. Fine-Tuning CLIP for CIFAR-10**

### **2.1 Dataset Integration**
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 images.
- **Text Prompts**: Labels converted into descriptive prompts (e.g., "An image of an airplane").
- **Transforms**:
  - Resizing images to match CLIP's input size.
  - Normalizing to CLIP's pre-trained specifications.

---

### **2.2 CLIP Fine-Tuning**
- A `CLIPFineTuner` class:
  - Fine-tunes CLIP's text and vision encoders.
  - Adds projection layers for aligning embeddings.
  - Computes similarities between text and image inputs.

---

### **2.3 Training Procedure**
- **DataLoader**: Handles the CIFAR-10 dataset with textual prompts.
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy to compare logits with ground truth.
- **Optimization**: AdamW optimizer for model fine-tuning.
- **Epochs**: 5 epochs of training with batch size 16.

---

### **2.4 Model Saving**
- The fine-tuned model is saved after each epoch for later use.

---

## **3. Fine-Tuning CLIP for Flickr8k**

### **3.1 Dataset Integration**
- **Dataset**: Flickr8k, containing image-caption pairs.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Captions are extracted and mapped to images.
  - Images are resized and normalized to match CLIP's pre-trained input specifications.

---

### **3.2 CLIP Fine-Tuning**
- A `CLIPFineTuner` class:
  - Fine-tunes CLIP’s text and vision encoders.
  - Adds projection layers for aligning embeddings.
  - Computes similarity scores between image and text embeddings.

---

### **3.3 Training Procedure**
- **DataLoader**: Handles the Flickr8k dataset.
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy to align image and text embeddings.
- **Optimization**: AdamW optimizer for training.
- **Epochs**: 30 epochs with batch size 16.

---

### **3.4 Model Saving**
- The fine-tuned CLIP model is saved for use in diffusion or captioning tasks.

---

## **Summary**
- The fine-tuned CLIP models for CIFAR-10 and Flickr8k are used to improve text-image alignment.
- The diffusion model utilizes these fine-tuned embeddings to generate images from text prompts.
- Combined, these approaches enable state-of-the-art text-to-image generation and image-captioning tasks.
